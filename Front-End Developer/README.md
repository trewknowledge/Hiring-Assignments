# Front-End Developer Coding Assignment

#Overview
The purpose of this assignment is to test your knowledge with using front-end frameworks to scaffold and develop responsive websites.

At Trew Knowledge, we use Foundation by Zurb as our front-end framework. While Foundation offers many great features & components, for this assignment we will just be using the XY Grid.

Before you begin the assignment, we highly recommend that you read the documentation, participate in some lessons, and watch the helpful videos listed below.

Foundation Docs - https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/

Learn the Flexbox XY Grid - https://zurb.com/university/lessons/learn-the-flexbox-based-powerhouse-xy-grid

#Coding Guidelines

Framework - You must use the Foundation XY Grid.
SASS -  Styles need to be written with SASS
Responsive - The website must be responsive and match the supplied design files.
Mobile First - You must take a “mobile-first” approach.

#Coding Challenge

First, download the design files located here. You will need to develop 2 pages in total for both desktop and mobile.

Within these two templates there are additional components such as modals, dropdowns, and accordions. You can write these components using jQuery and SASS.

#Challenge Completed?
Please send us a link to your GitHub repository where we can download your website.
